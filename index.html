                <p><strong> I hail from KwaMhlaba'uyalingana, the Northernest part of the KZN coast. What has got me here? My curiosity, my unquencable thirst to know a little about most things. I have a passion for innovation and advancement whether it be technology or purely social, Growth- I love the word.
                    Working in teams to develop and find solutions or execute big projects is what I enjoy most of the workspace. And so you'll find me involed in numerous community initaitives. 
                    I describe myself as a CEO in the making for two reasons. Firstly I enjoy everything assiociated with the corporate world and have an interset in how big decisions are made and how they influence the results of the company. Secondly I stay informed with company issues outside my area of function. 
                    To relax, give me a good movie with a great script and cast or better yet, to be part of a converstion with real substance -THAT makes my day.</strong>
